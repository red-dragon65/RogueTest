# RogueTest

This is a test game that explores creating a more advanced game using only Java.
Currently, it is retired to being a demonstration that shows what level of scale a game can be created using only Java.

### Project Setup
- The project is split into two main parts. There is the `town` and `dungeon`. These are two different game environments with different game mechanics.

### Progress
- Currently, you can walk around a small town and talk to people. You can also go to a store and purchase items that can be used in the dungeon.
The dungeon can also be accessed by going to the bottom edge of the screen and selecting a location from a list. In the dungeon, you can use attacks
and consume items.
- The current feature is creating enemy AI's in the dungeon that can attack the hero.
- Future features include room modules the user can walk into, and a cut scene creator using in game assests.

### Interesting features:
- Tile based dungeon generation of rooms and hallways with varying parameters
- Pixel based collision mask for the town
- Custom UI tools for creating dialogues and selection screens
- Grid based ranged attacks with selector

### Projects Future
- The project *might* switch to a maven module structure in order to make development easier, and to create custom dependencies.
- The project *might* proceed as an example of creating a game framework for making rogue-lite tile based games.
- The project *might* proceed development in Godot in order to have a better standard for public release.
- The project *might* proceed as a game development tool instead of an actual game.
